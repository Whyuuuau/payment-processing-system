## Known Limitations

- Endpoints have no auth (FIXME before production!)
- Test coverage pretty low, need more tests
- Haven't load tested, might fall over at scale
- No actual payment gateway integration yet (using simulator)
- Refund logic not fully tested
- Error messages could be better
- Missing webhook support
- No admin panel/dashboard

Pull requests welcome!
